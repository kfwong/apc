                <h1>APC in Bangkok: new markets but similar education challenges</h1>

                <img src="resources/th-conference.jpg" class="img-box"/>

                <p style="text-align:justify">APC Co-Founder and CEO Laurence Lien spoke at the Thailand Strategic Giving forum in Bangkok on 23rd August. The event was supported by The Rockefeller Foundation and Laurence shared on the early childhood education projects undertaken by Lien Foundation in Singapore, highlighting how philanthropists can address gaps on the government side. The panel also stressed the importance of working together - amongst funders, with the government and with the NGOs, in order to effectively address social issues. </p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">The forum discussed the problems, challenges and possible solutions to the education sector in Thailand. By bringing together some of the successful models from around the region, the organisers hope to inspire the local community to work on more scalable solutions for the country. </p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">APC met with many leading local philanthropists on this trip and introduced the platform and our collaborative projects. We are definitely looking forward to expanding into the Thai market, especially as we focus our attention for the mid-term on the Southeast Asia region. Do let us know if you have anyone to recommend to the circle!  </p>
