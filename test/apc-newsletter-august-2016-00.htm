                <h1>Asia Philanthropy Circle (APC) Member Update – August 2016</h1>

                <p style="text-align:justify">Dear APC members,</p>

                <p style="text-align:justify"><img src="resources/LaurenceLien.jpg" class="float-right img-box"/>We warmly welcome two new members to our community.  Victor Hartono and Jonathan Tahir – and the Djarum Foundation and Tahir Foundation respectively that they drive – are two key philanthropic players in Indonesia. Their short profiles are at <a href="#">Appendix A.</a></p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">Our members and their families represent more than US$40 billion in wealth.  More important than wealth is the influence that our members have in being a force for good and a key hope for change.  And as we inspire one another and collaborate, the collective impact can only grow.  </p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">APC’s impact goes beyond our members.  We are networked with more than 200 leading Asian philanthropists, most recently those from <a href="#">Thailand</a>.  Many are our supporters, even if they are not yet members.  We will continue to influence their philanthropy, but our key commitment would be to our members.  </p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">As an action-biased platform, APC members have launched eight collaborative projects.  Recently, we have added counter-radicalisation of youth in the Philippines and beyond, and special needs education in Malaysia.  (An update of the projects is at <a href="#">Appendix B</a>.)</p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">However, despite our solid beginnings, we are now at an inflection point and need new breakthroughs in order to re-generate momentum in growing membership and impact.</p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">Part of the plan then is to <strong>focus our expansion plans on ASEAN</strong>, where we have had great response, and would like to establish a strong foundation.  We still welcome members from China, and will continue to engage there.  </p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">As a voice for philanthropists, we are planning <strong>an ASEAN Philanthropy Dialogue</strong> for APC members to discuss with ASEAN government leaders how to synchronise the work of philanthropists to complement the respective governments’ efforts to address the social challenges in our midst.  A few APC members <a href="#">met the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Singapore</a> who has agreed to help APC launch this Singapore chairs ASEAN in 2018.</p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">In order to be more truly member-led, we are also exploring the piloting a <strong>country chapter</strong> with in-country staff support and a lead member overseeing the growth of membership and projects in that country.  This would increase local ownership and responsiveness.  The pilot country is likely to be Indonesia, which has a critical mass of 8 members.  The secretariat in Singapore will continue to provide strong guidance and oversight, apart from ensuring a common identity, and growing a regional community and cross-border work.   </p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">Programmes like leadership dialogues, workshops and field trips <strong>will increasingly be co-created with members</strong>, germinating from what individual members want to do and are already doing, and expanding to include other members’ participation more organically and opportunistically.  </p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">The APC Secretariat will also <strong>be more of an evangelist publicly</strong> – advocating more vocally for collaborative philanthropy and an Asian way of giving.   We plan to publish more White Papers, write more op eds, and be written about regularly in the media. </p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">The above is still very much work-in-progress.  As we are building something unique, we must continue to experiment and adapt, so that or creation may have high impact and be sustainable.  What is important is that this is your APC. So please actively give us feedback and help us to do better.  </p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">Meanwhile, we will continue to strengthen the APC Secretariat.  We sadly bid farewell to Mathias who returned to Switzerland in July 2016, after completing his two-year sojourn to Asia.  On a positive note, we welcome Stacey Choe and Berlinda Gooi join APC as Director and Deputy Director respectively.  They come with deep and relevant experience from the nonprofit sector – Stacey as former Director at Asian Venture Philanthropy Network in charge of policy and memberships, and Berlinda as Associate Director in charge of Alumni Relations at the Singapore Management University, Chicago Booth and INSEAD. (Do see their profile at <a href="#">Appendix C</a>.)</p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">At <a href="#">Appendix D</a>, you will find a list of upcoming events. Please take note and mark those of interest in your calendar. We especially look forward to welcoming more of you at <a href="#">venn2016</a>, our annual meeting on November 18-19 in Jakarta. </p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">Sincerely yours,</p>
